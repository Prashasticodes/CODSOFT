üìö Multi-Project Repository
This repository contains multiple machine learning projects. Each project is explained in detail below

PROJECT 1 
üé• Movie Genre Prediction Model
üìú Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. By analyzing the language used in plot descriptions, the model classifies movies into predefined genres such as action, comedy, drama, etc.

The project leverages techniques like TF-IDF for text vectorization and employs machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve accurate predictions.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Feature Engineering: Use of TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical representations.
Model Training: Implementation of multiple classifiers to compare performance.
Genre Prediction: Predicts the movie genre based on a given plot summary.
Validation Accuracy: 0.45059944666461726
model score   0.59126722706790


PROJECT 2 

üìß SMS Spam Classifier
üìú Project Overview
This project builds an AI model to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. By analyzing the content of messages, the model predicts whether a given message is unwanted (spam) or safe (legitimate).

üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used
Text Processing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF for feature extraction.
Machine Learning Models:
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

PROJECT 3 

Customer Churn Prediction
A machine learning project to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data, including demographics and usage behavior.

Project Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or not. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Bank Customer Churn Prediction.

Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding data trends.
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Implementation of machine learning algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
