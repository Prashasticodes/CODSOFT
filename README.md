üé• Movie Genre Prediction Model
üìú Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. By analyzing the language used in plot descriptions, the model classifies movies into predefined genres such as action, comedy, drama, etc.

The project leverages techniques like TF-IDF for text vectorization and employs machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve accurate predictions.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Feature Engineering: Use of TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical representations.
Model Training: Implementation of multiple classifiers to compare performance.
Genre Prediction: Predicts the movie genre based on a given plot summary.
